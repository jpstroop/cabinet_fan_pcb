# PCB for Network Cabinet Thermostat

This is a board, schematic, and libraries to go along with [jpstroop/cabinet_fan](https://github.com/jpstroop/cabinet_fan).

Most library devices (footprints, symbols) are original, but the trimpot was derived from [SparkFun's Eagle Libraries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries).

Datasheets included in this repository were generally found via links on the product pages, with the exception of the Adafruit BMP280, the dimensons for which were drived from their [Eagle files for the product](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP280-Breakout-PCB).
